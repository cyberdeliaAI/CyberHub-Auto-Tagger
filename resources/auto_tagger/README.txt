CyberHub Auto Tagger resources
================================

The optional Auto Tagger module uses:

  SmilingWolf/wd-eva02-large-tagger-v3
  https://huggingface.co/SmilingWolf/wd-eva02-large-tagger-v3
  License: Apache-2.0

The model is not bundled with CyberHub. Open Auto Tagger and click
"Install model" to download the pinned model.onnx and selected_tags.csv into:

  resources/auto_tagger/wd-eva02-large-tagger-v3/

Tagging and searching run locally after installation. Removing the downloaded
model does not remove tags already stored in the Gallery database.

NVIDIA acceleration (Windows)
-----------------------------
Selecting CUDA in Settings chooses the provider but does not install NVIDIA's
ONNX Runtime package. Stop CyberHub, then run from the CyberHub folder:

  .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip uninstall -y onnxruntime onnxruntime-gpu
  .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade "onnxruntime-gpu[cuda,cudnn]>=1.21,<1.27"

This selects the CUDA 12 / cuDNN 9 runtime family. ONNX Runtime GPU 1.27 and
newer use CUDA 13 by default and require a matching NVIDIA driver. The pip
packages do not install or update the NVIDIA display driver.

Restart CyberHub. The Runtime card should show CUDA. Azure is not used by this
module as a local execution provider.

If CUDA is listed but the first inference reports a missing
cudnn_engines_tensor_ir64_9.dll, repair the cuDNN wheel and restart CyberHub:

  .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall nvidia-cudnn-cu12

Auto Tagger validates CUDA with a short warm-up before processing the queue. It
will stop with an error instead of silently completing a large job on CPU.

Gallery folder jobs
-------------------
The Background tagging panel can target one folder from the Gallery index.
"Tag folder" processes only images that still need the current tag revision;
"Re-tag folder" replaces results for every image in that folder. Both actions
include subfolders. The most recently opened Gallery folder is selected when it
is available.

Performance
-----------
Inference batch size 0 selects batch 4 for CUDA, 2 for CoreML/DirectML and 1
for CPU. If the server reads originals from a NAS or mapped network drive,
select "Gallery thumbnail (fast)" in Settings -> Auto Tagger. Gallery thumbnail
files preserve the full composition, but can lose some fine-detail tag accuracy.
